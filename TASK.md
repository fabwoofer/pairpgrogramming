# Basis

This repo contains a lightweight express repository to fetch NASA images of the day. It should be tested, be able to run and typed appropriately.

## Task

The NASA API alows to fetch pictures of the day when not given a day. The documentation can be found here https://api.nasa.gov/

We want to...

1. create a test for the existing function
2. extend our API to accept a date which gets passed to the NASA API and return the data, including the date input accordingly.
3. create a test for the newly added functionality
4. talk about ways to improve the project
